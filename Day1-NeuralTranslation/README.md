# 7DaysOfAI
This is my seven day deep dive into AI by building projects solving real life problems
## DAY 1
### Neural Machine Translation
This refers to the translation of text from one language to another using a computer. We all see it daily when we use Google Translate. For our first day we will build a model that translates from English to French. Yes I would like doing English to Swahili but swahili datasets are not opensource. 

#### Dataset
THe dataset we will use to train our models will be located at
http://www.manythings.org/anki/
Download the French-English or just go crazy


### Approaches
There are many approaches for Neural translation the most common one uses Sequence to sequence models such as RNNs and GRUs. DOnt know what those are thats okay will upload a short chapter explaining them.

#### The best step by step explanation I found
https://github.com/tensorflow/nmt

#### Important Note
If you attempt to train or run my notebooks on your laptop It will die. Please use Colab or Kaggle Kernels

#### Side Note 
You are not alone. During the course of today I will upload notebooks showing MY step by step approaches. Feel free to comment ask question or fork this repository. Happy COding.
